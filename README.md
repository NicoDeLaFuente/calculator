## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vainilla JavaScript

### What I learned

This was a great challenge to recap Vainilla Javascript. I havenÂ´t written it in a while and it was really fun to do it. Help me to practice the logic and DOM manipulation. 

### Continued development

I am currently learning Next JS and I plan to lear Tailwind CSS really soon. Also, in June 2023 I will start my BackEnd Course so I will become a Full Stack Web Developer. That is my final goal since I get interested in this area.
